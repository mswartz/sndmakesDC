#Penn Quarter: Z-space

## What'd we make?
 
Our tool, called Z-Space, is a way to navigate non-linear stories using images. Users tap hot points on an image to follow narrative paths. Some images have multiple entrance points for interconnected narratives. The user decides which path to follow.
 
Z-Space fills a need for an alternative to linear storytelling methods for digital picture stories. Z-Space takes advantage of one of the Internetâ€™s strengths: non-linear exploration. Essentially, we wanted to explore ]how we might make a wikipedia-type rabbit hole but with images.

To show how Z-space works we chose a complex narrative.  
 
If our team had more time, we would fix the aspect ratios of the images to respond better to portrait versus landscape oriented images, automate connections, make the back and forward buttons in the browser work, create a node view rather than a list, and implement responsive images.
